# C-HW
Hello there,
This game, was a homework for the "Introduction C Programming Class" by Assistant Professor Tankut Akgul at Istanbul Technical University.
The current version is the older version submitted to the class system. 
I was unable to find the full version of the game with high score, higher fps and better effects.
This hw helped me learn a lot about file and structs syntax.
Also thanks to this homework i felt my skills of debugging improved significantly.
